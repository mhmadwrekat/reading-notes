# Git Intro

## Seeing Your Remotes

By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.


By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.


* example : 
1. [fetch](https://github.com/remote1/example)
2. [push](https://github.com/remote2/example)
