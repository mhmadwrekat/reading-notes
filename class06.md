## Objects Js
> *Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world , In an object variables and functions take on new names .*

* Like variables and named functions , properties and methods have a name and a va lue , In an object , that name is called a key .
* An object cannot have two keys with the same name , This is because keys are used to access their corresponding values .
* The value of a property can be a **string** , **number** , **Boolean** , **array** , or even another object , The value of a method is always a function .

### Example in Objects :
**let hotel = {**

    name : 'Wrekat' ,
    room : 25 ,
    booked : 20 ,
    roomTypes : ['twin' , 'double'] ,

    check : function () {
        return this.room - this.booked ;
    }
}

## Document Object Model
> The Document Object Model ( DOM ) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window .

Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps :

1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with .
2. Use its text content , child elements , and attributes
