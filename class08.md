## CSS Layout
>CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box , This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box .


It is common to group a number of elements together inside a **< div>** (or other block-level) element , For example , you might group together all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and the main navigation) . The **< div>** element that contains this group of elements is then referred to as the containing element .

## Examples CSS Layout 
* **The float property :** allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible , Anything else that sits inside the containing element will flow around the element that is floated .
* In normal flow , each block-level element sits on top of the next one , Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements , you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow , but the syntax would be : ***position : static ;***
* **Position : absolute ;** When the position property is given a value of absolute , the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page . ( They act like it is not there . )
