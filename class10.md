## DEBUGGING & ERROR

* When you are writing JavaScript, do not expect to write it perfectly the first time , Programming is like problem solving: you are given a puzzle and not only do you have to solve it , but you also need to create the instructions that allow the computer to solve it , too .

---

### Each time a script enters a new execution context , there are two phases of activity : 
1. PREPARE
 * The new scope is created
 * Variables , functions , and arguments are created
 * The value of the this keyword is determined
2. EXECUTE
 * Now it can assign values to variables
 * Reference functions and run their code
 * Execute statements


> In the interpreter , each execution context has its own variables object , It holds the variables , functions , and parameters available within it , Each execution context can also access its parent's variables object .

## HOW TO DEAL WITH ERRORS ?
1. debug the scrpit to fix errors .
 > If you come across an error while writing a script (or when someone reports a bug) , you will need to debug the code, track down the source of the error , and fix it .

2. handle errors gracefully
 > You can handle errors gracefully using try , catch , throw , and finally statements .

 > The JavaScript console will tell you when there is a problem with a script , where to look for the problem , and what kind of issue it seems to be .
