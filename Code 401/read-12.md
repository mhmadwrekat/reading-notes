# Pandas

Python is open source. It’s great, but has the inherent problem of open source: many packages do (or try to do) the same thing. If you’re new to Python, it’s hard to know the best package for a specific task. You need someone who has experience to tell you. And I tell you today: there’s one package you absolutely need to learn for data science, and it’s called ***pandas***.

Pandas is a game-changer for data science and analytics, particularly if you came to Python because you were searching for something more powerful than Excel and VBA. Pandas uses fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with relational or labeled data both easy and intuitive.


To load the pandas package and start working with it, import the package. The community agreed alias for pandas is pd, so loading pandas as pd is assumed standard practice for all of the pandas documentation .


A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different types (including characters, integers, floating point values, categorical data and more) in columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet, a SQL table or the data.frame in R .

- The table has 3 columns, each of them with a column label. The column labels are respectively Name, Age and Sex.

- The column Name consists of textual data with each value a string, the column Age are numbers and the column Sex is textual data.

tqdm, the one and only
When working with large datasets, pandas can take some time running .**map()**, .**apply()**, .**applymap()** operations. tqdm is a very useful package that helps predict when theses operations will finish executing .
