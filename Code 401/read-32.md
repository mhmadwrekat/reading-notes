## NextJs

To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

- Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
- You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
- You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
- You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.


***Next.js: The React Framework***

Enter Next.js, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.

Next.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:

- An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
- Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
- Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
- Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
- Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
- Development environment with Fast Refresh support
- API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
- Fully extendable


Next.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands.

## React Context for Beginners

React context is an essential tool for every React developer to know. I lets you easily share state in your applications .


![React Context for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2021/07/react-context-for-beginners.png)

***What is React context ?***

React context allows us to pass down and use (consume) data in whatever component we need in our React app without using props.

In other words, React context allows us to share data (state) across our components more easily.


***When should you use React context ?***

React context is great when you are passing data that can be used in any component in your application.

These types of data include:

- Theme data (like dark or light mode)
- User data (the currently authenticated user)
- Location-specific data (like user language or locale)
- Data should be placed on React context that does not need to be updated often.

***Why ?***

Because context was not made as an entire state management system. It was made to make consuming data easier.

You can think of React context as the equivalent of global variables for our React components.
