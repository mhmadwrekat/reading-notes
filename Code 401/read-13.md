# Linear Regressions

***How to run Linear regression in Python scikit-Learn***

Scikit-learn is a strong Python machine learning tool. Regression, classification, clustering, model selection, and data preprocessing are all functions included. “Methods intended for regression in which the target value is supposed to be a linear combination of the input variables” are found in the sklearn.linear model package.

we can import scikit-learn library As:

    ```python
    import sklearn

    ```

with scikit-learn library we can predict the output according to the data provided. for that we need to import Linear Regressions. we can do it as :

    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

    ```


Important functions to keep in mind while fitting a linear regression model are:

    lm.fit() -> fits a linear model

    lm.predict() -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients

    lm.score() -> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.

## Linear Regression in Python

- When Do You Need Regression? to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. For example, you can use it to determine if and to what extent the experience or gender impact salaries.

- What Is Regression? Simple linear regression is an approach for predicting a response using a single feature. It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related.

- Linear Regression Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques. It’s among the simplest regression methods. One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results.

## When Do You Need Regression ?
- to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related

- is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors.

- Regression is used in many different fields: economy, computer science, social sciences, and so on

- Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques. It’s among the simplest regression methods. One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results.

- The package ***scikit-learn*** : is a widely used Python library for machine learning, built on top of NumPy and some other packages. It provides the means for preprocessing data, reducing dimensionality, implementing regression, classification, clustering, and more. Like NumPy, scikit-learn is also open source.

- There are several ways in which you can do that, you can do linear regression using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn.

- ***Scikit-learn*** is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.

- ***sklearn.linear_model*** module : which contains “methods intended for regression in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the input variables”.

- steps to begin working :
1. import the required Python libraries into Ipython Notebook.
2. import data set into Ipython notebook and store it in a variable
3. convert data into a pandas data frame
