## How to use Random Module


We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc. When making your password database more secure or powering a random page feature of your website.


If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.

    import random
    print random.randint(0, 5)
    This will output either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.

## What is Risk Analysis

The probability of any unwanted incident is defined as Risk. In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.


**Why use Risk Analysis?**

In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.


**There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process. Those are as follows:**

- **Business Risks:** This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.

- **Testing Risks:** You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.

- **Premature Release Risk:** a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required

- **Software Risks:** You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.

*After identifying the risks associated with your software, the next step is to assess the risks; i.e, Risk Assessment.*


### **How to perform Risk Analysis ?**
There are three steps:

1. Searching the risk .

2. Analyzing the impact of each individual risk .

3. Measures for the risk identified .

## Test Coverage

If you make a certain level of coverage a target, people will try to attain it. The trouble is that high coverage numbers are too easy to reach with low quality testing. At the most absurd level you have AssertionFreeTesting. But even without that you get lots of tests looking for things that rarely go wrong distracting you from testing the things that really matter.


Like most aspects of programming, testing requires thoughtfulness. TDD is a very useful, but certainly not sufficient, tool to help you get good tests. If you are testing thoughtfully and well, I would expect a coverage percentage in the upper 80s or 90s. I would be suspicious of anything like 100% - it would smell of someone writing tests to make the coverage numbers happy, but not thinking about what they are doing.


The reason, of course, why people focus on coverage numbers is because they want to know if they are testing enough. Certainly low coverage numbers, say below half, are a sign of trouble. But high numbers don't necessarily mean much, and lead to ignorance-promoting dashboards. Sufficiency of testing is much more complicated attribute than coverage can answer. I would say you are doing enough testing if the following is true:

- You rarely get bugs that escape into production, ***and*** .

- You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.
