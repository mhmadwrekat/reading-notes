## Jupyter Lab

**What is Jupyter Lab ?**

JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter .


JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. For a demonstration of JupyterLab and its features .


You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters. Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing, for example:

1. Code Consoles provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output. A code console can be linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, for example.

2. Kernel-backed documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.

3. Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.

4. Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers. For example, it is easy to have live preview of Markdown, Delimiter-separated Values, or Vega/Vega-Lite documents.


*JupyterLab Releases*

Since JupyterLab 0.32 (February 2018), the releases of JupyterLab are suitable for general daily use by both Jupyter novices and users experienced with the Classic Notebook interface. As of the 1.0 release (June 2019), it is additionally ready for extension writers who wish to further customize the JupyterLab experience for others. Please review the Changelog for detailed descriptions of each release.


The extension developer API is evolving, and we also are currently iterating on UI/UX improvements. We appreciate feedback on our GitHub issues page as we evolve towards a stable extension development API.

## Numpy Tutorial

NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood. NumPy was originally developed in the mid 2000s, and arose from an even older package called Numeric. This longevity means that almost every data analysis or machine learning package for Python leverages NumPy in some way .

**Creating A NumPy Array**

We can create a NumPy array using the numpy.array function. If we pass in a list of lists, it will automatically create a NumPy array with the same number of rows and columns. Because we want all of the elements in the array to be float elements for easy computation, we’ll leave off the header row, which contains strings. One of the limitations of NumPy is that all the elements in an array have to be of the same type, so if we include the header row, all the elements in the array will be read in as strings. Because we want to be able to do computations like find the average quality of the wines, we need the elements to all be floats.
