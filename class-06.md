## An Introduction to Node.js

* ### ***What is node.js ?***

 > is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine .

>Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

* ### ***what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine ?***

The **V8 engine** is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute .

* ### ***Node Binaries vs Version Manager*** 
    
Many websites will recommend that you head to the official Node download page and grab the Node binaries for your system. While that works, I would suggest that you use a version manager instead. This is a program that allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will. There are various advantages to using a version manager. For example, it negates potential permission issues when using Node with npm and lets you set a Node version on a per-project basis .


    You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing node -v . If all has gone well, you should see something like v12.14.1 displayed. This is the current LTS version at the time of writing.

* ### ***How does pair programming work ?*** 

While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the **Driver** and the **Navigator** . The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code .
