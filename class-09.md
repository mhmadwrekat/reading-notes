## Functional Programming Concepts

* ### ***What is functional programming ?*** 

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program .

* ### ***What is a Pure Function ?*** 

>The function always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in. It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a program’s execution. It must only depend on its input arguments .

> The function does not produce any observable side effects such as network requests, input and output devices, or data mutation .

* ### ***What are the benefits of a pure function ?*** 

> My favorite benefits of pure functions are :

1. They’re easier to reason about .
2. They’re easier to combine .
3. They’re easier to test .
4. They’re easier to debug .
5. They’re easier to parallelize .

* ### ***What is immutability ?*** 

In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object  is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. This is in contrast to a mutable object (changeable object), which can be modified after it is created. In some cases, an object is considered immutable even if some internally used attributes change, but the object's state appears unchanging from an external point of view. For example, an object that uses memoization to cache the results of expensive computations could still be considered an immutable object .

* ### ***What is Referential transparency ?*** 

Referential transparency and referential opacity are properties of parts of computer programs. An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value (and vice-versa) without changing the program's behavior.This requires that the expression be pure, that is to say the expression value must be the same for the same inputs and its evaluation must have no side effects. An expression that is not referentially transparent is called referentially opaque .

## Node JS - Modules and require

* ### ***What is a module ?*** 

1. A standard or unit of measurement .

2. The size of some one part taken as a unit of measure by which the proportions of an architectural composition are regulated .

3. any in a series of standardized units for use together: such as :
   * a unit of furniture or architecture .
   * an educational unit which covers a single subject or topic .

4. An independently operable unit that is a part of the total structure of a space vehicle .

5. A subset of an additive group that is also a group under addition .

* ### ***require ( )***

* ### ***What does the word ‘require’ do ?*** 

**require()** is not part of the standard JavaScript API. But in Node.js, it's a built-in function with a special purpose , to load modules .
Modules are a way to split an application into separate files instead of having all of your application in one file , This concept is also present in other languages with minor differences in syntax and behavio .
