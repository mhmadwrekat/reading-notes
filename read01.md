# mastering mark down on github

Beautiful and very easy at the same time
It can be learned easily, you do not need to memorize large and huge terms
But some small, useful and purposeful icons at the same time
The way it is written makes you feel fun and you can't get bored of it, it's wonderful in my opinion
