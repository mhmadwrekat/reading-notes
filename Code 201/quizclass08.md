Whats position Doing ?

## Answers 
**1.** 

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box , This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box .

---
**2.**
* **Float**
* **Position : static**
* **Position : absolute**

---
**3.** 

**The float property :** allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible , Anything else that sits inside the containing element will flow around the element that is floated .

---
**4.**

In normal flow , each block-level element sits on top of the next one , Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements , you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow , but the syntax would be : ***position : static ;***
