### How Forms Work ?
* A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server .
* The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects .
* The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP , C# , VB .net , or Java , It may also store the information in a database .
* The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received .
