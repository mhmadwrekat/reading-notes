## HTML Boxes
> By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents , To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the **height** and **width** properties.

Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance :
* border
* margin
* padding
> The padding and margin properties are very helpful in adding space between various items on the page.

## Decisions and Loops (switch statement)
what is loops ?

Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false when analysed. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false.


* The switch expression is evaluated once.
* The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
* If there is a match , the associated block of code is executed.
* If there is no match , the default code block is executed .
