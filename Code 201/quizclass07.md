## Answers 
**1.** 

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem , A model describes the various entities , their attributes and behaviors , as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain , An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object - oriented model .

---
**2.**

* When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances , build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors .
* Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties .
* Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well .
* Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function .
* Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside .
* Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside .
