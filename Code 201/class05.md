## CSS Text
* **weight** : The font weight not only adds emphasis but can also affect the amount of white space and contrast on a page .
* **style** : Italic fonts have a cursive aspect to some of the lettering , Oblique font styles take the normal style and put it on an angle .
* **stretch** : In condensed (or narrow) versions of the font , letters are thinner and closer together , In expanded versions they are thicker and further apart .
