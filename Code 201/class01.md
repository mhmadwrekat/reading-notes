The events , methods , and properties of an object all relate to each other : Events can trigger methods , and methods can retrieve or update an object's properties .


How **HTML , CSS , JS** Fit Together ?

***HTML + CSS + JS***  The JS is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site .
Keeping it separate means that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the JS. You can also reuse the code on several pages (making the site faster to load
and easier to maintain).

## HTML : HTML5 Layout
**HTML5** introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

in the **example** the ***< footer>*** might contain links to share the article on social networking sites.

Who is the site for ?

Every website should be designed for the *target audience* - not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

of the pages that will be used
to structure the site. This is
known as a site map and it will
show how those pages can be
grouped .
