## HTML Images 
**EX :** < img src="images/magnolia-large.jpg"
class="large" alt="Magnolia" />

Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup .

* You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box .

* Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images , and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download .

> The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element , This could be the entire page or just part of the page .
