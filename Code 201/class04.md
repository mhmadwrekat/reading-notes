## HTML Links
> Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another  enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing .


The text between the opening **< a>** tag and closing **< /a>** tag is known as link text , Where possible , your link text should explain where visitors will be taken if they click on it .


On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder , Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories .

## CSS Layouts
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box , This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box .

It is common to group a number of elements together inside a **< div>** (or other block-level) element , For example , you might group together all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and the main navigation) . The **< div>** element that contains this group of elements is then referred to as the containing element .

## JS Functions , Methods , Objects
How memory and variables work ?

Global variables use more memory , The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded , Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed .

* functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task , a method is the same as a function , except methods are created inside ( and are part of ) an object .
* programmers use objects to create models of the world using data ,  and that objects are made up of properties and methods .
* the browse comes with a set of objects that act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages .
