# How computers Work ?
Computers use binary the digits 0 and 1  to store data  , A binary digit , or bit , is the smallest unit of data in computing , It is represented by a 0 or a 1. binary numbers are made up of binary digits (bits) , the binary number 1001.

The circuits in a computer's processor are made up of billions of transistors .  A transistor is a tiny switch that is activated by the electronic signals it receives . The digits 1 and 0 used in binary reflect the on and off states of a transistor .
All software , music , documents , and any other information that is processed by a computer , is also stored using binary .
