# Programming with JavaScript

## 1. Operators

- Assignment Operators
- Comparison Opeerators
- Arithmetic Operators
- Birwise Operators
- Logical Operators
- Strting Operators
- Conditional Operators
- Comma Operators
- Unary Operators
- Relational Operators

## 2. Expressions

An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.
Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value.
The expression **p = 5** is an example of the first type. This expression uses the **=** operator to **assign the value five to the variable p** . The expression itself evaluates **to five.**

The code **5 + 2** is an example of the second expression type. This expression uses the **+** operator to **add five and two** together without assigning the result, **seven**, to a variable.

## Function

Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

**Ex :**

function square(number)

 {
  return number * number;
}

## Control Flow

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
