## CSS Transitions
> With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.


**EXAMPLE...**

div 

 {
  
    -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
 
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
 
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
 
          transform: scale(1.5);
 } 

> Transform Style On occasion three-dimensional transforms will be applied on an element that is nested within a parent element which is also being transformed. In this event, the nested, transformed elements will not appear in their own three-dimensional space , To allow nested elements to transform in their own three-dimensional plane use the transform-style property with the preserve-3d value , Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup .

> Animations Keyframes To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @ keyframes rule. The @ keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated .
