## React - Forms

* ### ***What is a Controlled Component ?***

We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.


* ### ***Note :*** 
    
    You can pass an array into the value attribute, allowing you to select multiple options in a select tag:

    >    < select multiple = { true } value = { [ 'B', 'C' ] } >

* ### **Alternatives to Controlled Components :**

It can sometimes be tedious to use controlled components, because you need to write an event handler for every way your data can change and pipe all of the input state through a React component. This can become particularly annoying when you are converting a preexisting codebase to React, or integrating a React application with a non-React library. In these situations, you might want to check out uncontrolled components, an alternative technique for implementing input forms.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator

![The Conditional (Ternary) Operator](https://scotch-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_auto,q_auto:good,f_auto/v1562952581/jqctyinrganjts991d3w.jpg)

1. The **condition** is what you’re actually testing. The result of your condition should be **true** or **false** or at least coerce to either boolean value .

2. A **?** separates our conditional from our true value. Anything between the **?** and the **:** is what is executed if the **condition** evaluates to *true*.

3. Finally a **:** colon. If your **condition** evaluates to *false*, any code after the colon is executed.
