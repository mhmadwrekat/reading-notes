## Nosql VS Sql

* ### ***SQL vs NoSQL : High-Level Differences*** 

1. SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database .

2. SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to .

3. SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data .

4. SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load .

5. SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database .

6. SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb .

* ### ***SQL Database Examples :*** 

**1. MySQL Community Edition :** MySQL database is very popular open-source database. It is generally been stacked with apache and PHP, although it can be also stacked with nginx and server side javascripting using Node js .

**2. MS-SQL Server Express Edition :** It is a powerful and user friendly database which has good stability, reliability and scalability with support from Microsoft .

3. **Oracle Express Edition :** It is a limited edition of Oracle Enterprise Edition server with certain limitations. This database is free for development and deployment .

* ### ***NoSQL Database Examples :*** 

1. **MongoDB :** Mongodb is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema. It has been developed by the founders of DoubleClick, written in C++ and is currently being used by some big companies like The New York Times, Craigslist, MTV Networks .

2. **CouchDB :** CouchDB is also a document based NoSQL database. It stores data in form of JSON documents .

3. **Redis :** Redis is another Open Source NoSQL database which is mainly used because of its lightening speed. It is written in ANSI C language .
