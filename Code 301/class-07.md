## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team ?


> New research reveals surprising truths about why some work groups thrive and others falter .

#### THE WORK ISSUE : REIMAGINING THE OFFICE

* How to Build a Perfect Team
* The War on Meetings
* The Case for Blind Hiring
* Failure to Lunch
* The 'Good Jobs' Gamble
* Rethinking the Work-Life Equation
* The Rise of White-Collar Automation
* The Post-Cubicle Office
* The New Dream Jobs

    > many of today’s most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers ­— a practice known as ‘‘employee performance optimization’’ — isn’t enough. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based. One study, published in The Harvard Business Review last month, found that ‘‘the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more’’ over the last two decades and that, at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employee’s day is spent communicating with colleagues .

 In 2012, the company embarked on an initiative — code-named Project Aristotle — to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared. Dubey, a leader of the project, gathered some of the company’s best statisticians, organizational psychologists, sociologists and engineers. He also needed researchers. Rozovsky, by then, had decided that what she wanted to do with her life was study people’s habits and tendencies. After graduating from Yale, she was hired by Google and was soon assigned to Project Aristotle.

## How I explained REST to my brother ?

* ### ***Who is Roy Fielding ?*** 

>He's smart , He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser .

* ### ***What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created ?*** 

That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing .

That Because it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

* ### ***What is REST ?*** 

In 2000, Roy Fielding proposed Representational State Transfer (REST) as an architectural approach to designing web services. REST is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia. REST is independent of any underlying protocol and is not necessarily tied to HTTP. However, most common REST API implementations use HTTP as the application protocol, and this guide focuses on designing REST APIs for HTTP.

* ### ***HTTP Verbs***

There are 4 basic HTTP verbs we use in requests to interact with resources in a REST system :

1. **GET** : retrieve a specific resource *( by id )* or a collection of resources  .
2. **POST** : create a new resource .
3. **PUT** : update a specific resource *( by id )* .
4. **DELETE** : remove a specific resource *( by id )* .
