## React lifecycle

![Reack Lifecycke](https://miro.medium.com/max/5000/1*XcGM-8E_hGl4fpAr9wJIsA.png)

* ### ***What are component lifecycle events?***

React lets you define components as classes or functions. The methods that you are able to use on these are called lifecycle events. These methods can be called during the lifecycle of a component, and they allow you to update the UI and application states.

* ### ***React Lifecycle***

1. Mounting
2. Updating
3. Unmounting

* ### ***What does componentDidMount do?***

This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().

## React Bootstrat Documentation

* ### ***Rebuilt with React***

React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.


As one of the oldest React libraries, React-Bootstrap has evolved and grown alongside React, making it an excellent choice as your UI foundation.

* ### ***Bootstrap at its core***

Built with compatibility in mind, we embrace our bootstrap core and strive to be compatible with the world's largest UI ecosystem.

By relying entirely on the Bootstrap stylesheet, React-Bootstrap just works with the thousands of Bootstrap themes you already love.

* ### ***Accessible by default***

The React component model gives us more control over form and function of each component.

Each component is implemented with accessibility in mind. The result is a set of accessible-by-default components, over what is possible from plain Bootstrap.

## React State Vs Props

![React State Vs Props](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/React-State-vs-Props-1.png)

* ### ***What types of things can you pass in the props ?***

props enable you to pass variables from one to another component down the component tree. In the previous example, it was only a string variable. But props can be anything from integers over objects to arrays .

* ### ***What is the big difference between props and state ?***

Props and state are related. The state of one component will often become the props of a child component. Props are passed to the child within the render method of the parent as the second argument to React.createElement() or, if you're using JSX, the more familiar tag attributes.

* ### ***When do we re-render our application ?***

A re-render can only be triggered if a component's state has changed. The state can change from a props change, or from a direct setState change. The component gets the updated state and React decides if it should re-render the component.
