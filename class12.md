## Chart.js API
* Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create .

* To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart . js can draw our chart .

## Basic usage
*The < canvas> element differs from an < img> tag in that, like for < video>, < audio>, or < picture> elements, it is easy to define some fallback content to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. You should always provide fallback content to be displayed by those browsers .*
